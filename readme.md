# Strong British People

Note: the info in this repo has been migrated over to [https://climbing-history.org/](https://climbing-history.org/). This repo is no longer maintained.

This is a list of strong british climbers, separated by gender and discipline. The idea is to have a list of the top 100 or so hardest sport climbers and boulderers. The grade boundaries are chosen to try and keep the list at around 100 people on each lsit.

Currently the cutoff is 8a sport and 7C/V9 boulder for women, and 8c sport and 8B/V13 for men.

The tables are based on data from threads on UKBouldering.com, the individual threads are linked in each list.

For the purposes of these lists, a sport route means you have to tie in and only clip bolts on the way up. Where someone has climbed some hard trad (i.e. >8a for women or >8c for men) this does not count (although it is very impressive!) Boulder problem traverses do not qualify (e.g. Traverse of the Gods at Crag-y-longridge, Pedigree Chum at Chee Dale). Boulder problems requiring a rope do qualify (e.g. The Fly at Rumney) but preference is given to longer routes where possible, so if a climbers has 2 ascents at a given grade but one is a boulder problem on a rope then the other ascent will be preferred.

A boulder problem is anything close to the ground, including longer boulder problems (e.g. The Wheel of Life). Where possible straight up problems are preferred, so if a climber has 2 ascents at a given grade where one is a long traverse and another is a straight up problem then the straight up will be preferred.

Where possible grades given are based on current concensus. First ascents are marked with a (x). Where there is some irregularity regarding the grade it will be mentioned in the notes.
